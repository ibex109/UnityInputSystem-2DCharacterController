# UnityInputSystem-2DCharacterController

A 2D character controller based [on the one from Brackeys](https://github.com/Brackeys/2D-Character-Controller) for the new unity input system.

The controller features:
- Smooth movement
- Jumping
- Crouching
- Events for setting up animation
- 2D Physics

Note, the character controller works differently than the one from Brackeys. You do not need to create a player movement script to call the character controller. Everything is done inside the player script.
